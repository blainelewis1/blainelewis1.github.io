I've got an equal interest in visualising data. Algomations are a combination of my interests where I learn a new algorithm (usually math related) and create an animation to show it!","technologies":["Javascript","Math","CSS"]},{"title":"Balance","featured":1,"url":"/projects/balance","resources":[{"type":"image","url":"images/projects/balance.png"}],"summary":"Currently this is a prototype with semi realistic physics where you attempt to balance a stick on a cart.

The end goal is to be able to dynamically place obstacles and generate a delaunay triangulation that can be used for pathfinding. The \"fish\" or school will then pathfind as a group using a combination of A* and the triangulation. Once they can successfully pathfind I intend to experiment with various group dynamics.","technologies":["Javascript","Math","Geometry"]},{"title":"This website","featured":4,"url":"blainelewis1.github.io","resources":[{"type":"image","url":"images/projects/schools.png"}],"summary":"I built this in an attempt to learn responsive design without using a framework, and also learn how to use angular.
