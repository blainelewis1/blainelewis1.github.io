# Longer Delays Increase Expert Use in Rehearsal-based Interfaces

Rehearsal-based interfaces are a particular type of interface where both novices and experts invoke commands using a nearly identical interaction. The most famous version of this is a marking menu <Cite bibKey="Kurtenbach" />

Other examples of rehearsal-based interfaces are FastTap, OctoPocus and Markpad, but there are many, many more. We can actually decompose the components of these interfaces by using a descriptive model.

Most interfaces from academia use a delay ranging from 200ms to 500ms. Commercial applications like Blender and Fusion tend to use shorter delays. Despite this large range of delays there has been little work to identify the effect of delay on a user's performance and overall experience. The original idea behind adding a delay in the first place was threefold:

1. Computers were slower, so there needed to be a delay to render the menu.
2. If the menu showed up too soon it might be jarring.
3. It might encourage expert use.
