                        I'm <span class="b">Blaine Lewis</span> and a Master's student at the University of Waterloo. I study
                        Human Computer Interaction supervised by Professor Daniel Vogel. My research is focused on helping
                        users become more efficient through the design of interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        My previous projects have studied the impact increased effort has on expertise development as well as two new interaction
                        techniques for improving hotkey use. The underlying reasons behind why interaction techniques work
                        are more important to me than the interaction technique itself. I'm especially interested in leveraging
                        research from cognitive psychology for developing new interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        As my research matures I want to shift towards other avenues of helping users perform "better" by focusing on error prevention,
                        confidence, and domain specific metrics.
