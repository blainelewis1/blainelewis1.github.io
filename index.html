                        I'm <span class="b">Blaine Lewis</span> and a PhD student at the University of Toronto. My advisor is Tovi Grossman and my research falls under the field of Human Computer Interaction. I use the design of subtle interface features to improve everybody's well-being.

                        Well-being can mean many things: my past research has improved productivity and aimed to create a sense of accomplishment; my future research aims to give people control over how they use technology. At the end of the day, I hope to make somebody's life just a little bit better through my research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        Robust and open science play a critical role in my research. I'm driven to improve the way I report and conduct my analysis to better the scientific community.
