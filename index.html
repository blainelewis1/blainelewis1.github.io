        I'm going to climb a big wall. I'm going to do a thru hike (probably pacific crest). </article>

        <!-- TODO: picture of me here, sits on left side unless mobile in which case it goes below about me and above the blurb
        <article>
          <p>
            I'm a twenty something who's just finishing up a degree specialising in computer sciences. I'm from Edmonton, Canada but I've lived in a few places. I'm happiest near mountains but even happier if there's an ocean nearby too.
            I built my first game in Adobe Flash when I was 13 years old and I've been in love ever since (but definitely not in love with Adobe Flash). I'm always learning with some new language or something. At the moment I'm reading a ton of books on Javascript and writing everything I can think of in it. It's my favourite language if you ignore all of its quirks.

          <p>
            Wanna collab? Need a belayer, hiking partner, or whatever? Contact me, I'll be sure to get back at you.
            Special note: If you're looking for free things I'd love help you. Granted, you need to have a reason. Like if you run a non profit and want some development like a website or something I'll do my best!
