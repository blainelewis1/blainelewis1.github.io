      <header>Let's have a heart to heart.</header>

      <p>
        I deliver products that speak for themselves. I'm a technically strong engineer and I take great pride in being great at what I do. It's important that my work makes an impact, developing internal tools isn't usually my thing. I can drive product vision or develop with equal skill and when possible I love to do both. I've learnt to embrace the parts of my job I don't love whether it be developing an internal tool I didn't want to or doing some grunt work because everything makes me stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe that people are worth more than their work experience. I spend equal amounts of time developing career relevant skills as I do random skills. I constantly refresh my worldview by exposing myself to other countries and I build lasting relationships with everybody I meet. I often hike, play squash or rock climb. But I'm always on the lookout for more hobbies that can help me grow and meet more people.
