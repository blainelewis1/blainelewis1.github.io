            I'm a twenty something who's just finishing up a degree specialising in computer sciences. I might do a master's degree in Human Computer Interaction, but we shall see. I'm from Edmonton, Canada but I've lived in a few places. I'm happiest near mountains but even happier if there's an ocean nearby too.

            Wanna collab? Need a belayer, hiking partner, or whatever? Contact me, I'll be sure to get back at you.
            Special note: If you're looking for free things I'd love help you. Granted, you need to have a reason. Like if you run a non profit and want some development like a website or something I'll do my best!
