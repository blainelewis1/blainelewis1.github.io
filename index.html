                        I'm <span class="b">Blaine Lewis</span> and a Master's student at the University of Waterloo. I
                        study
                        Human Computer Interaction supervised by Professor Daniel Vogel. My research is focused on
                        helping
                        users become more efficient through the design of interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        My previous projects have studied how increasing effort impacts expertise development. I have
                        also designed new interaction techniques for improving hotkey use. The underlying principles of
                        interaction techniques are more important to me than the interaction technique itself. I'm
                        especially interested in leveraging
                        research from areas such as cognitive psychology and behavioural economics for developing new interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        As my research matures I want to better understand how we should evaluate interaction techniques and move away from the focus on time and errors.
