          Experimental Framework
        </h2>
        <p>I built an experimental framework to allow for fast prototyping of experimental designs and deployment
          across
          a variety of devices. The framework works with Electron or in modern browsers. For simiplicity it stores data
          using Amazon S3. Participants can be recruited in any manner you can provide a link (eg. crowdsourced via
          Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower or via email.) It is built using React and Redux. It includes some
          built-in components you can try <a href="https://blainelewis1.github.io/KeyMap">here</a>. An example
          experiment
          can be completed <a href="https://blainelewis1.github.io/KeyMap/?knob-Text=Example%20Message&selectedKind=experiment%2F&selectedStory=ExposeHK&full=1&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=0&addonPanel=storybook%2Factions%2Factions-panel">here</a></p>

      <h2>
        Delay Experiment
      </h2>
      <p>The delay experiment was built using vanilla Javascript and Materialize for CSS. Users complete a series of
        tasks using a marking menu or a FastTap clone. After completion of the expderiment the user's data is uploaded
        to a framework called CrowdCurio.</p>

      <p>The code for TrackBoard is not publicly available but it allows users to gesture type using their trackpad on
        a laptop. It is written using Swift and Cocoa's AppKit.</p>

        Resume
      </h2>
      <p>My resume acts as a testing ground for different frameworks I'm trying to learn. Currently it is written using
        React and Materialize. However, in the past it has been written using vanilla Javascript with my own styling,
        AngularJS, and Angular. This website acts as the same to a lesser extent, it uses Tachyons for styling.</p>

                        I'm <span class="b">Blaine Lewis</span> and a Master's student at the University of Waterloo. I study
                        Human Computer Interaction supervised by Professor Daniel Vogel. My research is focused on helping
                        users become more efficient through the design of interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        My previous projects have studied the impact increased effort has on expertise development as well as two new interaction
                        techniques for improving hotkey use. The underlying reasons behind why interaction techniques work
                        are more important to me than the interaction technique itself. I'm especially interested in leveraging
                        research from cognitive psychology for developing new interaction techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                        As my research matures I want to shift towards other avenues of helping users perform "better" by focusing on error prevention,
                        confidence, and domain specific metrics.
