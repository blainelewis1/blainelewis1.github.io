			This should feel a bit more personal, small blurb at the top talking about me,
			followed by the things I've done and probably a picture with each.

			It's mostly a showcase of my personality and my creativity.

			It should be a full recounting of absolutely everything I've done, whether it be a job,
			project or anything else. It'll contain some of the same stuff as my resume and
			seem kind of redundant but I think it'll pay off.

			Maybe I should make it chronological with year serperators? but only if each looks pretty full.

			Should it change with moblile? Good question.

			It should tell a story. Eg. 2008. Where it all began, flash games, built flash games, skip forward, mchs.

			My resume is actually a piece of art. Everything is populated using angular.
			The presentation and data layer are completely seperate which makes making changes incredibly easy.

			I developed a permalinking feature that allows me to create new versions on the fly, filled with only
			the relevant experience. For example, navigate to blainlew.is/resume and youll see a control at the top.
			You can also click different experiences.

			When you're done, copy the link created and walla, it's entirely customised.

			Lots and lots and lots of pictures, kelseys website, stantec websites, etc.
			Quadcopter? pi?

			visit, view, play buttons depending on content.

			Sections

			Summary:
				Projects
				Experience
				Skills (Break down into different sections with links to where I've used them, how many times, skill level etc. eg. Web (front, backend), Databases, Application, etc.)
				About

			Timeline with all those in order
